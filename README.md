The tool can open, view, modify, import, and export files within the .MET files of Backyard Baseball 2004 for the PlayStation 2.

# Features
- Open .MET Files: Easily open .MET files to explore their contents.
- View Files: Browse and view files within the .MET archive.
- Modify Files: Edit the contents of files within the .MET archive.
- Import/Export Files: Import new files into the .MET archive or export existing files to your computer.
- Save Changes: Save modifications to the .MET file, ensuring your changes are applied.

To access the .MET files, you need to extract the game files from the iso using Winrar or 7zip. 

If you modify files, you need to save the modified file to .MET (Under the Edit tab is a Save File Changes) option. You can then take the modified .MET file and repack it back into the .ISO; which can be done using ImgBurn to repack the game files into an .ISO and boot up the modified game.
(This may support more games, but I haven't found another game that uses a .MET file yet)
